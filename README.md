generate sample file: run below by replacing X and Y with number lines (X) and number of words per line (Y).
  to generate a 100Mb file (try 1 million lines with 12 words per line)

ruby -e 'a=STDIN.readlines;*X*.times do;b=[];*Y*.times do; b << a[rand(a.size)].chomp end; puts b.join(" "); end' < /usr/share/dict/words > file1G.txt

{x: 10000, y: 5} = 500K file
{x: 300000, y: 8}= 250M file
